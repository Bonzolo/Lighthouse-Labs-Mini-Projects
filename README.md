# Mini Projects

## Project 1 - London API
Tools of focus: API calls, JSON

This project focused on utilizing API calls from London Transport to extract required information from JSON files 

## Project 2 - Yelp & Foursquare API
Tools of focus: postgresSQL, pandas, JSON, API calls

This project involved retreiving requests from Yelp and Foursquare APIs. The goal was to compare the data obtain via the two API calls to determine which was better for recommending places of interest when visiting the Calgary Tower. 

## Project 3 - Unsuprvised learning: Banking Behavior of Customers
Tools of focus: Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, pandas

The objective of this project was to use unsupervised learning to identfiy customer banking behavior. Clustering was done based off of demographics, transcations, chequing, saving, and credit accounts to find associated patterns.
